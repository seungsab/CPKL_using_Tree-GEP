Compositional Kernel Learning using Tree-based Genetic Programming (CPKL_Tree-GEP) for Gaussian Proecess Regression

The source codes in this repository are uploaded for the replication of results section for the following work.

- Jin, S. Compositional kernel learning using tree-based genetic programming for Gaussian process regression. Struct Multidisc Optim 62, 1313â€“1351 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1007/s00158-020-02559-7

The uploaded source codes are only working for the 2-dimensional Mathematical test function ("Branin function").
The source codes cannot be opened to public yet. To apply the method to your own application, please contact to "seungsab@gmail.com".

Three methods can be implemented by running the following m-files
- Run_Singel_kernel_GPML.m: Gaussian Process using single kernels
- Run_AUTO_GPR_GPML_HCPKL.m: Gaussian Process using Hierarchical CPK
- Run_AUTO_GPR_GPML_GPlab.m: Gaussian Process using CPKL_Tree-GEP

All results given in the manuscript are in the folders as "1_Test_functions" and "2_Physical_models"
- To see the results from Matehmatical test functions, run "Plot_Results_Test_function.m"
- To see the results from Physcial models, run "Plot_Results_Physcial_models.m"

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me: seungsab@gmail.com (Seung-Seop Jin).


Note) These source codes are developed in MATLAB R2018b. They may not be working below MATLAB R2018b.
